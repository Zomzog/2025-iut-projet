# My little copilot instructions

## General answering guidelines

- Be concise and to the point.
- Don't make up answers; if unsure, say "I don't know."
- Don't butter me up, just give me the facts.
- If I'm wrong, say it directly.

## General Development Practices

- Always follow SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles.
- Adhere to OWASP security best practices.
- Break tasks into the smallest units and solve step by step.
- Look at stock-common to see if a global solution exists.

## Spring Development Practices

- Override only the required part in a test profile for tests with Spring Boot context.
- Use layers when it is possible.
- Always use `stock-common` when possible for shared logic or utilities.
- If `stock-common` lacks required functionality, propose a fix or extension to it before implementing a local solution.

## Java Development Practices

- Use AssertJ for test assertions.

## Kotlin Development Practices

- Use AssertK for test assertions.
- Use Either for error handling with sealed classes when it makes sense.
